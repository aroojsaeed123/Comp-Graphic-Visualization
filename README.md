#How do I approach designing software?
#Designing software is perhaps a technique used in various places. I see this as an oppurtunity to develop my skills.
#What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
#I never thought i would be able to design 3D objects.
#What design process did you follow for your project work?
#I follow the OpenGl library designs.
#How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
#if i will be sucees i can able to adopt these to develop games.
#How do I approach developing programs?
#I would definetely consider developing the program by implementing the stretegies i used in this class.
#What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
#Adding a texture is the best strategy i have learned.
#How did iteration factor into your development?
#Iteration is the part of development process. I learned everything from scretch and is still learning.
#How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
#My approach to develop projects are continously developing as i always learned something new in each milestone.
#How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
#My goal is to become software engineer. This can only be achieved by taking computer science.
#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
#It can help in various places like education i can implememt the things i learned so far. 
#How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
#It can be applied to develop games and 3D scenes.
